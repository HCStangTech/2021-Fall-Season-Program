# 2021-Fall-Season-Program
Programming files from the 2021 BEST Robotics fall season

Final Program:
This program includes improvements and creation to the functions that are used to run autonomous. These improvements include a
proper cancel button that you only have to press once and a specific funciton for moving the claw. This program also has a different path
for autonomous so that it drags the pipe bundle out by lowering the claw on top of the pipe bundle and pulling it out of the autonomous zone.

Previous Program:
This is the program that the robot ran on before the improvements made in the last program. It only has a function for driving and
you would have to press the cancel button multipule times to get the robot to stop running autonomous.
